# Welcome to Jmoe's Profile

hey! Welcome to my GitHub. I'm a software engineer working in the Observability and OpenTelemetry space. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or send me an email for a chat (see sidebar).

For a repository that I led the development on, and I'm very proud of, check out the [atlassian-sampling-processor](https://github.com/atlassian-labs/atlassian-sampling-processor), a tail-based distributed tracing sampler which focuses on high throughput, memory optimisation, and auto-scaleability. 

Over the years I've had the privilege of being an active member of the OpenTelemetry community. Many of my contributions have been to the OpenTelemetry Collector, which I'm a triager and a codeowner for a bunch of components; However I've also contributed to the OpenTelemetry spec, semantic conventions, Java SDK, and Go SDK.
